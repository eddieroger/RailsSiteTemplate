# SiteTemplate
Yet Another Attempt at a standardized Rails starting point. 

## Why? 

Good question. Like the attempted Sinatra base I made a while back, the best I can come up with is I'm drawn to do crazy things when it starts snowing, like reinvent the wheel. Yeah, it's snowing in Indiana in November - not novel, but not awesome, either. 

Also, why not? It's not like there's a fixed number of bits available on the Internet. 

## Should I Use This? 

If you want to. I plan to. I want to spin up a few different Rails sites over the next few weeks, and they all have a similar base-set of requirement - Bootstrap (deal with it), Device, Rails itself. So why not create a single upstream that I can use to maintain these base feature. At least that's the plan.

## Cool, I like it. Can I contribute? 

If you want to. I love PRs.
